Below is an updated concept for your app that imports photos from disk, deskews and crops them, and ultimately produces high‐quality PDFs. In this revised design, the image processing pipeline leverages two key Python libraries:
	•	deskew: to automatically detect and correct skew in document images.
	•	Pillow: to open, crop, resize, convert, and perform other image manipulations.

Below is a detailed “Canvas‑Mode” concept outlining the business and technical components:

1. Overview and Objectives

Objective:
Develop a Python-based application that processes photos of documents (such as invoices or receipts) captured via a mobile device or scanner. The main pre‑processing steps are to deskew the images (correct any tilt) and crop them so that the document is isolated and formatted as a proper DIN A4 page. The final output is a PDF that can be used for digital archiving.

Key Functional Enhancements (using deskew and Pillow):
	•	Deskewing: Automatically detect the rotation angle of the text using the deskew library and rotate the image to ensure that the text runs horizontally.
	•	Cropping and Adjustments: Use the Pillow library to crop the image to remove extraneous background, resize the document to a standard aspect ratio, and perform additional enhancements (e.g., conversion to grayscale) before generating a PDF.

2. Functional Requirements
	1.	Photo Import:
	•	The app will read images from a specified folder (using Python’s os or pathlib modules) on macOS.
	•	The user can point the app to the disk location where photos are stored.
	2.	Image Pre‑processing Pipeline:
	•	Open the Image: Use Pillow to open each image file.
	•	Deskewing:
	•	Convert the image to grayscale if needed.
	•	Use the deskew library to calculate the skew angle of the text in the image.
	•	Rotate the image (using Pillow’s .rotate() method) by the negative of the detected skew angle to deskew it.
	•	Cropping:
	•	Apply a cropping routine with Pillow’s .crop() method to isolate the document. This step might include automated border detection or a fixed cropping strategy (for example, to extract the central DIN A4 region).
	•	Optional Enhancements:
	•	Convert the processed image to grayscale.
	•	Adjust brightness/contrast if needed.
	3.	PDF Generation:
	•	Once images are deskewed and cropped, convert them into PDF pages using a PDF generation library (e.g., ReportLab or FPDF). This is the next phase in your workflow.
	4.	User Feedback:
	•	Provide basic feedback (via a CLI or simple GUI) listing the imported images, their detected skew angles, and a preview (or summary) of the processed output before generating the final PDF.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Platform:
The solution will run on macOS, using Python (recommended version 3.9 or newer).
	•	Performance:
Deskewing and cropping operations are computationally lightweight for a moderate number of images. For high-volume batches, consider asynchronous processing or incremental processing.
	•	Modularity and Extensibility:
The design is modular, allowing you to:
	•	Replace or upgrade the deskew algorithm if necessary.
	•	Expand the cropping logic to support different document layouts.
	•	Integrate additional pre-processing features (e.g., noise reduction, contrast adjustment) before PDF conversion.
	•	Maintainability:
Using open source libraries (deskew and Pillow) ensures that your code remains maintainable and can leverage community updates. Clear abstraction layers (import, deskew, crop, PDF generation) will make future enhancements straightforward.

4. Proposed Architecture

A. System Components
	1.	File Importer Module:
	•	Scans a specified directory for image files.
	•	Uses Python’s os/pathlib to enumerate files (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
	2.	Image Processor Module:
	•	Deskew Submodule:
	•	Converts the image to grayscale (if necessary).
	•	Applies the determine_skew() function from the deskew library.
	•	Uses Pillow’s .rotate(angle, expand=True) to correct the skew.
	•	Crop Submodule:
	•	Uses Pillow’s .crop() method to trim the image so that only the document remains.
	•	May include functions to crop the central region or detect document edges.
	•	Enhancement Functions (Optional):
	•	Convert to grayscale.
	•	Adjust contrast/brightness as needed.
	3.	PDF Generator Module:
	•	Converts the processed images into a PDF document.
	•	Utilizes a Python PDF library to combine images into a single file.
	4.	User Interface:
	•	CLI Option:
Command-line arguments (using argparse) for specifying the folder and additional options (e.g., deskew tolerance, crop dimensions).
	•	(Optional) GUI Option:
A simple GUI could later be implemented (using Tkinter) to preview images before processing.

6. Example Code Outline

Below is a simplified snippet that demonstrates integrating deskew and Pillow:

import os
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
from deskew import determine_skew

def process_image(file_path):
    # Open image using Pillow
    img = Image.open(file_path)
    
    # Convert to grayscale for deskew detection
    img_gray = img.convert("L")
    
    # Use deskew to determine the skew angle
    skew_angle = determine_skew(np.array(img_gray))
    
    # Rotate image by negative of the detected angle
    # 'expand=True' ensures the whole rotated image is preserved
    deskewed_img = img.rotate(-skew_angle, expand=True)
    
    # Define a crop box (this might be customized or automatically computed)
    # For example, crop to the central region (modify as needed)
    width, height = deskewed_img.size
    crop_box = ((width - 600) // 2, (height - 800) // 2, (width + 600) // 2, (height + 800) // 2)
    cropped_img = deskewed_img.crop(crop_box)
    
    return cropped_img

def process_folder(directory):
    directory = Path(directory)
    processed_images = []
    for file in directory.rglob("*"):
        if file.suffix.lower() in {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png'}:
            try:
                processed = process_image(file)
                processed_images.append((file.name, processed))
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error processing {file}: {e}")
    return processed_images

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import argparse, numpy as np  # numpy needed for deskew
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Process images with deskew and crop using Pillow")
    parser.add_argument("folder", type=str, help="Directory containing images")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    results = process_folder(args.folder)
    print(f"Processed {len(results)} images.")
    # Optionally, save or further process these images (e.g., generate a PDF)
    for name, img in results:
        img.save(f"processed_{name}")

Notes:
	•	The example uses Pillow to open and manipulate images.
	•	The deskew library’s determine_skew() function is applied on a NumPy array derived from a grayscale image.
	•	The deskewed image is then cropped to a fixed box (you may later replace this with a more intelligent crop based on document detection).
	•	Finally, the processed image is saved to disk.

7. Future Enhancements
	•	Dynamic Cropping:
Develop an algorithm to automatically detect document edges (e.g., using edge detection or contour finding in Pillow) instead of a fixed crop box.
	•	PDF Generation:
Integrate with a PDF library to compile the processed images into a single PDF.
	•	Advanced Pre-processing:
Optionally add filters (e.g., brightness, contrast adjustments) to optimize images for OCR.
	•	User Interface:
Create a GUI (using Tkinter or PyQt) for interactive preview and fine-tuning of the deskew and crop parameters.

8. Conclusion

This updated concept now focuses on using the deskew library for detecting and correcting image skew and uses Pillow for all further image manipulations (cropping, resizing, enhancement). The modular design allows you to process scanned or photographed documents in a robust pipeline, ultimately producing clean, deskewed, and cropped images ready for OCR or PDF generation. This approach provides a solid foundation that is both maintainable and extensible for your project.

Feel free to modify the design based on your specific requirements and to integrate additional libraries or custom algorithms as needed.
